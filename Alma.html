    <h2>Alma 32</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma32.png">
    <p>Faith begins as a small desire, like a seed, and if nurtured through humility and obedience, it will grow into a strong and perfect knowledge of truth.</p>
    <h2>Alma 33</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma33.png">
    <p>The words of ancient prophets like Zenos, Zenock, and Moses testify that people should pray and exercise faith in the Son of God to receive His mercy and salvation.</p>
    <h2>Alma 34</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma34.png">

    <h2>Alma 35</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma35.png">
    <p>The Zoramites who believed in Alma’s teachings were cast out, found refuge with the people of Ammon, and how the anger of the remaining Zoramites led to increasing tensions and war preparations with the Lamanites.</p>
    <h2>Alma 36-42</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma36-42.png">
    <p>Alma counsels his sons—teaching them about his own conversion, the power of the scriptures, the importance of faith, repentance, chastity, life after death, resurrection, and how God’s justice and mercy work together through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <h2>Alma 43-44</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma43-44.png">

    <h2>Alma 45-51</h2>
    <img src="images/alma/alma45-51.png">
